```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Examples of multivariate data

```{r load-packages, include=FALSE}
# Load the required libraries
library(ade4)
```


```{r olimpic}
data("olympic", package = "ade4")
athletes = setNames(olympic$tab, 
  c("m100", "long", "weight", "high", "m400", "m110", "disc", "pole", "javel", "m1500"))
athletes[1:3, ]
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
