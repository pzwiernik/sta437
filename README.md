# STA 437/2005  Winter 2025: 
## Methods for Multivariate Data


<img src="pics/cover.png" align="left" width="150"> This course introduces modern methods for multivariate data building also some theoretical foundations. The lecture is divided into five blocks: I. Foundations of Multivariate Analysis, II. Multivariate statistical Inference, III. Dimensionality Reduction Techniques, IV. Covariance matrix modelling and estimation, V. Methods for Tensors.
