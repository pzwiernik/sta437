# STA 437/2005  Winter 2025: 
## Methods for Multivariate Data


<img src="pics/cover.png" align="left" width="150"> This course introduces modern methods for multivariate data building also some theoretical foundations. The lecture is divided into five blocks: I. Foundations of Multivariate Analysis, II. Multivariate statistical Inference, III. Dimensionality Reduction Techniques, IV. Covariance matrix modelling and estimation, V. Methods for Tensors.

[Lecture notes](STA437Notes.pdf) (the file will be expanded and updated as the course progresses so don't print the whole document)

The lecture notes cover all the material presented in class. Some of the textbooks I used:
* (MKB) K.V. Mardia, J.T. Kent, J.M. Bibby (2024) [Multivariate Analysis, 2nd edition](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Multivariate+Analysis%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781118738023)
* (ET) Brian Everitt, Torsten Hothorn (2011) [An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R]()
* (HH) Susan Holmes, Wolfgang Huber [Modern Statistics for Modern Biology](https://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/)

### Grading scheme (in chronological order)
(20%) midterm 1,  (20%) midterm 2,   (20%) final project,  (40%) final exam

The midterms are short (1 hour) and they focus on simple conceptual/theory questions.
